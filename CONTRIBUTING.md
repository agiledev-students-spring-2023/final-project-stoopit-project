# Contributions
This document outlines the rules for contributing to Stoop-It and instructions on setting up locally. 

## Basic Rules
1. Please refer to [Commit Style Guide](https://gist.github.com/ericavonb/3c79e5035567c8ef3267) and abide by them for commit messages.
2. Make sure code is linted (Team uses ESLint 8.34.0)
3. Make sure code is unit-tested and is bug-free. If your code breaks or fails, YOU need to FIX them.
4. Try to comment your code as readable and clear as possible.
5. Before making a pull request, make sure the code is clean- NO commented blocks of code or unnecessary blocks should be included.
6. If something is unsure, always ask first in the Discord channel and finalize once the team is in agreement.
7. Once the pull request has been reviewed, delete the branch that is no longer needed.
## Git Workflow
Make sure to create a new (separate) branch per feature and create a Pull Request, which will then be reviewed by the team and merged if approved.

DO NOT push to the master/main branch.
## Setting up Locally
Create a local clone from the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/agiledev-students-spring-2023/final-project-stoopit-project.git
``` 
Install dependencies in the package.json file.
```javascript
npm install
```
## Building and Testing
